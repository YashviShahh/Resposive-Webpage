## Resposive-Webpage
### A fully featured , responsive web page that can adapt to the size of the visitor’s viewport. 

Here, my goal is to make the content render differently depending on the device or screen size so that visitors have an optimal experience no matter how they access a website. The primarily benefit of responsive web design is that sites load quickly without any distortions, so users don’t need to manually resize anything to view content.
